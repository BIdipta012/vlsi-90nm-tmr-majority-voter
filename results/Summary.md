# Results Summary

## Key Findings

✅ **Velocity saturation exploitation** yields 38% power reduction at 
   constant 21.29 ns delay (W_eff = 190 nm optimal)

✅ **Exceptional post-layout resilience**: only 0.26% delay degradation 
   (5× better than standard cells at 10–50%)

✅ **Area-normalized FOM = 26 × 10⁶** achieves 7.4× improvement over 
   low-end 28nm voters despite 3.2× larger technology

✅ **DRC/LVS-verified** layout (167.2 μm²) with full parasitic extraction
